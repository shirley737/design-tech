            Design technologists (also known as UX engineers, UI engineers,
            prototypers, and more) live at the intersection between designers
            and developers, with both programming and crafting skills.
            Specifically, they build prototypes for user testings, create
            internal tools to boost efficiency, and explore advanced
            technologies by building proofs-of-concept.{" "}
